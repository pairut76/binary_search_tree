## Data Structures

## Objectives:
Code and impliment different Data Structures and examine the cost, benefits and time efficiencies of each model.
Models Implimented:

  1. AVL Tree
  2. Binary Search Tree
  3. Hash Table
  4. Linked List

Each Data Structure has its on advantage and disadvantage which will be tested and examined and tested for time efficiency. Each will have its own class and methods associated - they will have similar methods:

  Trees will have the depth of the nodes
  Will contain size - returns how many values are stored in the tree
  ability to add, remove and find/locate elements or objects
  
The key difference is the structured used to store the values. Some methods will be costly, but quicker to search through - vice-versa. Depending on the data sets and what the purpose of the program is one data structure would be best suited for the job.

## Data Structures:

  1. AVL Tree - Similar to Binary Tree but is balanced. This allows for easier searching through the nodes.
  2. Binary Search Tree - Splits information being stored in half. 
  3. Hash Table - hash functions stored in buckets.
  4. Linked List - nodes connected to each other linearly.

Each Data Structure contains its own class and methods (depending on the structure of the data).


Users can test the different Data Structures implimented.

## Conclusion:
There are a list of words from the dictionary which stored in the different Data Structures above.
Compare and contrast each Data Structure - by storing the entire dictionary of words and timing each method:

  - How long does it take to store the values?
  - How long does it take to run a search for a value?
